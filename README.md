# Hertie School/CIVICA PhD Workshop: A Gentle Introduction to LaTeX 

LaTeX is a typesetting software that can be used in the preparation of all kinds of high-quality documents, presentations and posters. Since the text processing engine is based on traditional typesetting rules, it delivers superior output when compared to most word processors (e.g. MS Word) and is on par with desktop publishing programs (e.g. InDesign, Scribus). Regarding stability and resource efficiency, it is an attractive alternative to using word processors â€“ in particular when it comes to preparing and formatting longer texts.

This workshop will provide participants with an overview of what LaTeX is, what it is capable of, and what it can be used for. We will then proceed to take a closer look at the functionality and commands that enable participants to use the system on their own.
